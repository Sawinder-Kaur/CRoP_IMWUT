# CRoP_IMWUT

This work introduces CRoP, a novel static personalization approach using an off-the-shelf pre-trained model and pruning to optimize personalization and generalization. CRoP shows superior personalization effectiveness and intra-user robustness across four human-sensing datasets, including two from real-world health domains, highlighting its practical and social impact. This repository contains five folders - 4 for each of the datasets and 1 for all runtime evaluations. 

The folders corresponding to the four datasets: WIDAR, Extrasensory, Stress-sensing and PERCEPT-R, contain the model, code, and instructions to run the corresponing codes are provided. 

The folder for runtime evaluations contain separate folders for runtime evaluation on different platforms.
